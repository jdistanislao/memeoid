## TODO
### Before memeoid is barely usable

* Write tests for everything
* Also serve the gifs under /gifs/


### For feature-completeness

* Allow to POST a yaml template, validate it, save it for later reuse
* Add a url handler for templates, not gifs

### Future enhancements

* Don't normalize the image
* Profile the code to speed up larger gifs
