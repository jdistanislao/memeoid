## TODO
### Known bugs
* Trailing space in the form is not trimmed
* some css won't hurt


### For feature-completeness

* Allow to POST a yaml template, validate it, save it for later reuse
* Add a url handler for templates, not gifs
* Add a way to list and visualize templates

### Future enhancements

* Don't normalize the image
* Profile the code to speed up larger gifs
